## 🛠 Usage

This kit is designed for use within an Agentic environment (like **Gemini Code Assist** or **Cursor**).

- **To use an Agent**: Switch to the persona or reference them in your instructions (e.g., "Act as the Project Manager").
- **To use a Workflow**: Type the command in the chat (e.g., `@[/git-cm]`, `@[/plan]`).
- **To use a Skill**: The agent will automatically select relevant skills based on your request (e.g., "Create a 3D scene" triggers Three.js skills).
